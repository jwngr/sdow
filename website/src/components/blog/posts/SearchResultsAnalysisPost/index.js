    <Title>Insights From The First 500,000 Searches</Title>
    <Subtitle>
      <StyledLink href="https://jwn.gr">Jacob Wenger</StyledLink> | March 14, 2018
    </Subtitle>

    <P>
      A little over two weeks ago, I released{' '}
      <StyledLink href="/">Six Degrees of Wikipedia</StyledLink>, a website which allows you to find
      the shortest hyperlinked paths between any two pages on the world's largest free online
      encyclopedia. Since then, it has handled nearly 500,000 searches! With that decent sample
      size, I dove into the data and found some interesting &mdash; and sometimes comical &mdash;
      insights.
    </P>

    <SectionTitle>Most Popular Searches</SectionTitle>

    <P>
      Despite Wikipedia comprising almost six million pages, only{' '}
      <b>{data.percentUniqueSearches}%</b> of the searches have been unique, meaning one out of
      every four searches is for something that has already been searched:
    </P>

    <StatsWrapper>
      <Stat>
        <p>Total Searches</p>
        <p>{getNumberWithCommas(data.totalSearches)}</p>
      </Stat>

      <Stat>
        <p>Unique Searches</p>
        <p>{getNumberWithCommas(data.uniqueSearches)}</p>
      </Stat>
    </StatsWrapper>

    <P>
      The main reason for this is that some searches were <i>really</i> popular. Each of the top
      searches can be traced back to an online forum or website where someone posted a search they
      thought was funny or intriguing, leading others to click the link and try the same query. Here
      are the top ten by search count, including the source where the search was shared:
    </P>

    <Table headers={data.mostPopularSearchesHeaders} rows={data.mostPopularSearchesRows} />

    <P>
      The ability to share searches via URLs was a last-minute feature added the day before
      releasing the project. These numbers make me glad I added it.
    </P>

    <SectionTitle>Most Popular Pages</SectionTitle>

    <P>
      Filtering out duplicates and looking at the total count of searches which include a page as
      the start or end, the following pages are the most popular:
    </P>

    <Table headers={data.mostPopularPagesHeaders} rows={data.mostPopularPagesRows} />

    <P>
      Quite a lineup right there! Hitler running away with the top spot is not unexpected because
      internet and because of the somewhat popular{' '}
      <StyledLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wiki_Game#Variations">
        Clicks to Hitler
      </StyledLink>{' '}
      game in which you try to navigate to Hitler's Wikipedia page from another random Wikipedia
      page. On a related note, my apologies to the{' '}
      <StyledLink href="https://www.reddit.com/r/degreestohitler/">r/degreestohitler</StyledLink>{' '}
      subreddit for possibly spoiling all their fun.
    </P>

      After Hitler, we've got the last two US Presidents, the son of God (to many), Mr.{' '}

      from Sacramento called{' '}
      <StyledLink href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Grips">Death Grips</StyledLink>. That
      last one caught me by surprise. After some online searching, all I could come up with to
      explain it was an r/deathgrips thread from last month called{' '}
      <StyledLink href="https://www.reddit.com/r/deathgrips/comments/7q9l51/six_degrees_of_death_grips/">

    <SectionTitle>Average Degrees of Separation</SectionTitle>

    <P>
      People seem to be consistently surprised about how few clicks it takes to get from one
      Wikipedia page to another. It actually takes some time and effort to find pages which are
      separated by four or more links. Across all unique searches, here is the average degrees of
      separation:
    </P>

    <StatsWrapper>
      <Stat>
        <p>Average Degrees of Separation</p>
        <p>{data.averageDegreesOfSeparation.toFixed(4)}&deg;</p>
      </Stat>
    </StatsWrapper>

    <P>
      <i>
        <b>Note:</b> The average above does not include searches with the same start and end page
        (that is, with zero degrees of separation) nor searches with no path between the start and
        end pages.
      </i>
    </P>

    <P>
      This number is not intended to be scientific and probably does not extrapolate to the entire
      graph. I expect if you pick any two pages at random, they will on average have more degrees of
      separation than the number above. But this is probably a decent proxy and clearly shows that
      my site should more accurately be called <b>Three Degrees of Wikipedia</b>.
    </P>

    <SectionTitle>Most Degrees of Separation</SectionTitle>

    <P>
      Averages can be useful, but it is often much more interesting to look at the outliers. And
      when I did, I came across some searches with degrees of separation that were much higher than
      I was expecting. The longest path found to date has an incredible <b>11 degrees</b> of
      separation from{' '}
      <StyledLink href="/?source=Embleton&target=McCombie">Embleton → McCombie</StyledLink>, thanks
      to a long tail in the search path:
    </P>

    <Image src={elevenDegreesOfSeparationSearchImage} />

    <P>
      Looking at a histogram of searches according to their degrees of separation, it becomes clear
      how rare it is for them to have 6 or more degrees of separation:
    </P>

    <BarChart />

    <P>
      Big shout out to the 502 people who tried searches with the same start and end pages. Thanks
      for keeping me honest.
    </P>

    <SectionTitle>Searches With The Most Paths</SectionTitle>

    <P>
      It is not only surprising how few clicks it takes to get from one page to another, but also
      how many different paths you can take to get there. Here are the most results for each degree
      of separation:
    </P>

    <Table headers={data.mostPathSearchesHeaders} rows={data.mostPathSearchesRow} />

    <SectionTitle>Searches With No Paths</SectionTitle>

    <P>
      It turns out you cannot reach every page from any other page. Some pages are dead-ends or part
      of their own small islands with few incoming and outgoing links. In fact,{' '}
      <b>{data.percentNoPathsSearches}%</b> of all unique searches have no path from the start to
      end pages:
    </P>

    <StatsWrapper>
      <Stat>

    <SectionTitle>Server Response Times</SectionTitle>

    <P>
      One of the most difficult parts of making <b>Six Degrees of Wikipedia</b> &mdash; and the one
      that took up a large chunk of my time &mdash; was making it fast. After looking at server
      response times over the past two weeks, I'm really pleased with how quickly results are found.
      Here are some stats:
    </P>

    <StatsWrapper>
      <Stat>
        <p>Average Server Response Time</p>
        <p>{data.averageDuration} s</p>
      </Stat>
      <Stat>
        <p>Median Server Response Time</p>
        <p>{data.medianDuration} s</p>
      </Stat>
      <Stat>
        <p>95th Percentile Server Response Time</p>
        <p>{data.percentile95Duration} s</p>
      </Stat>
      <Stat>
        <p>99th Percentile Server Response Time</p>
        <p>{data.percentile99Duration} s</p>
      </Stat>
    </StatsWrapper>

    <P>
      <i>
        <b>Note:</b> The times above represent time taken on the server and do not include the
        entire response time, which varies depending on where in the world the user was who made the
        request and their network speed.
      </i>
    </P>

    <P>
      <i>
        <b>Another note:</b> The search itself runs much faster than the times above and most of the
        time is actually spent querying the MediaWiki API to fetching page information like its
        image URL and description which I do not store in my database.
      </i>
    </P>

    <P>
      Because I was curious, I decided to see what search took the longest to respond to. The search
      itself has little to do with how long it took to respond. This search just happened to be made
      during a time of high traffic in which my server was slowed down. But, boy oh boy, was I
      rewarded when I discovered what the actual search was:
    </P>

    <StatsWrapper>
      <Stat>
        <p>Longest Response Time</p>
        <StyledLink href="https://www.sixdegreesofwikipedia.com/?source=Penis&target=Adolf%20Hitler">
          Penis → Adolf Hitler
        </StyledLink>
        <p>38.96 s</p>
      </Stat>
    </StatsWrapper>

    <P>Sometimes you gotta love the internet...</P>

    <SectionTitle>Show Me The SQL</SectionTitle>

      For those fellow developers out there who are interested in the SQL queries used to generate
      these stats, you can find them all on{' '}
      <StyledLink href="https://github.com/jwngr/sdow/tree/master/website/src/components/blog/posts/SearchResultsAnalysisPost/queries.txt">
        this project's GitHub

      post.
    </P>

    <SectionTitle>Wrapping Up</SectionTitle>

    <P>
      <StyledLink href="/">Six Degrees of Wikipedia</StyledLink> captured the attention and
      excitement of so many people for the same reasons I decided to build it in the first place: it
      is entertaining to explore the concept and see the unexpected connections between seemingly
      random topics. It is also intriguing to dive into the stats behind the project like we just
      did.
    </P>

    <P>
      Are there other stats you would like to know? Or are there other topics related to the project
      you want to read about? If so, please reach out to me on{' '}
